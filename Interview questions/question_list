* = difficulty more * means the harder the question was

Programming Questions to go over:

	8/5/2017
		Median of Two Sorted Arrays****
		Contains Duplicate III***
		4Sum ***
		4Sum II *** -actually pretty easy but look over it anyways

Questions: 

	8/5/2017
		-2Sum	*	   
		-3Sum **
		-3Sum Smaller **
		-3Sum Closest **
		-4Sum ***
		-Contains Duplicate I *
		-Contains Duplicate II *
		-Contains Duplicate III ***
		Reflection:
			-all 3 sum algorithm questions require knowledge of how to solve the sorted version of the 2 sum question
			-Contains Duplicate is a set of question that utilizes HashMaps
			-Contains III uses something similar to bucket sort to get O(n) runtime
				-Like bucket sort but uses the parameter "t" to distinguish which bucket they go into
			-4 Sum relies on 3 Sum which relies on 2 Sum

	8/6/2017
		-Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters***

Future Questions/Algorithms to look over:
	-Sliding window technique 
	-Sliding window technique for substrings
	-Dynamic Programming questions
	-Bit Maniuplation questions

Goals:
	-Do Chapters 1 - 4 for CTIC
	-Do Questions on LeetCode for certain companies

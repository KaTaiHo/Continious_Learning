		-2Sum	*	   
		-3Sum **
		-3Sum Smaller **
		-3Sum Closest **
		-4Sum ***
		-Contains Duplicate I *
		-Contains Duplicate II *
		-Contains Duplicate III ***
		Reflection:
			-all 3 sum algorithm questions require knowledge of how to solve the sorted version of the 2 sum question
			-Contains Duplicate is a set of question that utilizes HashMaps
			-Contains III uses something similar to bucket sort to get O(n) runtime
				-Like bucket sort but uses the parameter "t" to distinguish which bucket they go into
			-4 Sum relies on 3 Sum which relies on 2 Sum
